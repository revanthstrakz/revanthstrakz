# 👨‍🚀 Revanth Rao Thopucherla – Code Whisperer | Kernel Jockey | Cloud Crusader ☁️

> “Why reinvent the wheel when you can Dockerize it, deploy it on Kubernetes, and pretend it’s a spaceship?”

Welcome to the chaotic jungle of my digital mind—a place where Golang meets Flutter, the Linux kernel gets more love than my social life, and AI thinks it’s smarter than me (sometimes, it actually is).

## 🚀 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Revanth – a Senior Software Engineer, full-stack wrangler, and someone who thinks `tail -f` is therapy. I’ve touched more stacks than a pancake chef and spent quality time debugging things that shouldn’t exist in the first place. 

I'm the guy who builds IoT firmware in the morning, optimizes AI pipelines by lunch, and pushes kernel commits before bed. Sleep is for weak CI pipelines.

## 🔧 What I Do (when caffeine hits just right)

- Write **Go** code that doesn’t panic (usually).
- Build **microservices** that are more stable than my internet connection.
- Fine-tune **LLMs** to generate sentences I wish I had written myself.
- Craft **Flutter** UIs so smooth, they make Material Design blush.
- Dockerize everything. Including README files. (Coming soon™)
- Hunt and fix bugs in embedded systems like they owe me money.
- Build AI pipelines so complicated, I need a map to find my own code.

## ⚙️ Tech I Don’t Just List on My Resume (I actually use it)


Languages:        Go, Python, C++, C, JS/TS, Dart (a.k.a the league of syntactic chaos)
Frontend:         React, Next.js, Angular, Flutter (I touch grass… rarely)
Backend:          FastAPI, Fiber, Flask, Node.js (REST or RESTless)
Databases:        PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, DuckDB (because ducks are cool)
Cloud:            AWS, Azure, GCP (No loyalty, just uptime)
DevOps:           Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Prometheus (because I love YAML pain)
Embedded:         OpenWRT, UART, SPI, I2C, Linux Kernel (yes, I void warranties)
ML/AI:            PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, LLMs (I bribe GPUs for attention)

## 🧠 Side Quests / Projects / Things That Broke Me (in a good way)

* `Strakz-Kernel`: My love letter to Android devices. Kernel so optimized, it bench-presses your battery life.
* `Revenge`: A personal trading platform that doesn’t rage-quit. Unlike me during backtesting.
* `Resume Engine`: AI-generated resumes because I got tired of rewriting "team player" 87 times.
* `ChatGPT Addon`: Talk to ChatGPT for free... until OpenAI catches on. 😉
* `ObsidianSync`: Because my notes need Git more than I need therapy.

## 📜 Certificates (AKA evidence that I clicked "Next" 400 times)

* ISC² Candidate (Cybersecurity): Because zero-days are fun until they’re yours.
* Advanced Linux Kernel: Learned things. Still afraid of `dmesg`.
* Ethereum DApps: When I wanted to be a crypto bro, but settled for gas fees.

## 🕶️ Vibe Check

* Fluent in English, Telugu, and Speaking In Stack Traces™
* Location: Hyderabad, India (but most of my code lives on the cloud)
* Status: Debugging life
